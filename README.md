# MACHINE-LEARNING

## Introduction to Python

The `Python-Introduction` folder consists of basic commands in python to use dictionnaries, arrays, or pandas. It doesn't contain machine learning, just the basics of python.

## Supervised learning

The `Supervised-Learning` folder contains all the supervised learning models introduced during this session, both for regression and classification. There is also a laboratory that implements from sratch the use of a Feed Forward Neuronal Network without the use of any libraries, to classify data.

## Unsupervised learning

The `Unsupervised-Learning` folder contains the laboratory that presents the K-Means algorithm, which is used to cluster different classes.

## Reinforcment learning

The `Reinforcment-Learning` folder contains a laboratory presenting the use of the Value function algorithm, the Q-learning algorithm as well as the policy function implemented from scratch.
